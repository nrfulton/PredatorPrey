<h1>Help/About</h1>
This simulator models a predator/prey system.
Whenever a predator and a prey end on the same tile, the prey dies and the predator produces 1 offspring.
Each full couple of <i>surviving</i> prey produce one offspring each round.

In each phase of the simulation, you will first place the predators and then place the prey.
The message the top of the screen tells you whether you are currently placing predators or prey,
and how many are available.
You can place preadtors/prey by checking boxes. Once you place enough predators, you will immediately be asked to place the prey.
After placing the predators, the full board is revealed. You must then press a button to continue on to the next epoch.

The game continues until one class goes extinct.
